   <h2> Drinking water is the most precious resource on Earth.</h2>

   <h4><p> Drinking water is the most precious resource on Earth. In the past few decades, the quality of drinking water has significantly degraded due to pollution. <br>Water quality assessment is paramount for the well-being of the people since the presence of pollutants can have serious health issues.
     <br>Particularly, in developing countries such as India, water is not properly assessed for its quality.
     <br>This work uses machine learning techniques to predict the water quality of Indian rivers.</p></h4>
